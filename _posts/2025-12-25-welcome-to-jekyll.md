Hey there and happy Christmas! Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
I built this new little personal site after running into some issues with the original one. As it's near the end of my second year at Hopkins, I've experienced some ups and downs, both academically and personally, since starting my PhD journey. I’d like to use this space to reflect and share my thoughts along the way.
Stay tuned, and feel free to check back often! I'll update this site in several weeks, hopefully.
